# MCP Server Builder

**Tier:** POWERFUL
**Category:** Engineering / AI Integration
**Maintainer:** Claude Skills Team

## Overview

Design and ship production-ready MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers from API contracts. Covers tool definition best practices, resource providers, prompt templates, OpenAPI-to-MCP conversion, TypeScript and Python server implementations, transport selection (stdio, SSE, StreamableHTTP), authentication patterns, testing strategies, and deployment configurations. Treats schema quality and tool discoverability as first-class concerns.

## Keywords

MCP, Model Context Protocol, MCP server, tool definition, resource provider, prompt template, stdio transport, SSE transport, OpenAPI to MCP, AI tool server, Claude tools

## Core Capabilities

- **Tool design & schema quality** — verb-noun naming, description engineering, typed input schemas, LLM-friendly output formatting
- **Server implementation** — TypeScript (`@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`) and Python (`mcp[cli]`) servers; tool/resource/prompt registration; structured error handling; logging, auth, and rate-limit middleware
- **Transport & deployment** — stdio (local/CLI), SSE (web), StreamableHTTP (production), Docker containerization, health checks, graceful shutdown
- **Testing & validation** — schema validation, MCP Inspector integration tests, contract/snapshot tests, load testing for remote servers

## When to Use

- Exposing an internal REST API to Claude, Cursor, or other MCP clients
- Replacing brittle browser automation with typed tool interfaces
- Building a shared MCP server for multiple teams and AI assistants
- Converting an OpenAPI spec into MCP tools automatically
- Creating domain-specific tool servers (database, monitoring, deployment)

## References

Load the reference that matches the task — keep this file lean and pull detail on demand:

- **[references/tool-schema-design.md](references/tool-schema-design.md)** — naming conventions, description engineering template, and input schema best practices. Read first when defining any tool, since description quality drives LLM tool selection.
- **[references/server-implementation.md](references/server-implementation.md)** — complete TypeScript and Python server code (tools, resources, prompts) plus the OpenAPI-to-MCP conversion rules and script. Read when writing the server.
- **[references/transport-and-deployment.md](references/transport-and-deployment.md)** — client configuration (`claude_desktop_config.json` for stdio and remote) and the tool versioning strategy. Read when connecting clients or planning releases.
- **[references/testing-and-troubleshooting.md](references/testing-and-troubleshooting.md)** — schema validation function, MCP Inspector commands, common pitfalls, best practices, troubleshooting table, and success criteria. Read when validating, hardening for production, or diagnosing failures.

## Scope & Limitations

**This skill covers:**
- Designing tool schemas, resource providers, and prompt templates for MCP servers
- Implementing servers in TypeScript (`@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`) and Python (`mcp[cli]`)
- Transport selection and client configuration (stdio, SSE, StreamableHTTP)
- OpenAPI-to-MCP conversion patterns and testing strategies

**This skill does NOT cover:**
- Building MCP clients or custom LLM orchestration layers — see `engineering/agent-workflow-designer`
- Designing multi-agent systems that consume MCP tools — see `engineering/agent-designer`
- API design itself (REST conventions, endpoint naming, versioning) — see `engineering/api-design-reviewer`
- Infrastructure provisioning, container orchestration, or CI/CD pipelines for deploying MCP servers — see `engineering/ci-cd-pipeline-builder`

## Integration Points

| Skill | Integration | Data Flow |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| `engineering/api-design-reviewer` | Review the underlying REST API before converting it to MCP tools | OpenAPI spec → API review findings → refined spec → MCP conversion |
| `engineering/api-test-suite-builder` | Generate integration tests for the HTTP endpoints that MCP tools wrap | MCP tool definitions → endpoint mapping → test suite generation |
| `engineering/agent-designer` | Design agents that consume the MCP tools this skill produces | MCP tool schemas → agent tool inventory → agent behavior design |
| `engineering/observability-designer` | Add structured logging, tracing, and metrics to MCP server handlers | MCP server code → instrumentation plan → logging/tracing middleware |
| `engineering/ci-cd-pipeline-builder` | Automate build, test, and deploy pipelines for MCP server releases | MCP server repo → pipeline config → automated deploy to staging/prod |
| `engineering/env-secrets-manager` | Manage API keys, database credentials, and tokens used in MCP server configs | MCP server env vars → secrets audit → secure injection patterns |
